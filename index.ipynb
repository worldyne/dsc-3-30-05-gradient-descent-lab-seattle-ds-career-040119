    "In order to practice gradient descent, lets begin by investigating a simple regression case in which we are looking to minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) between our predictions and the actual values. Remember that this is referred to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. Below, is a mock dataset that we will work with. Preview the dataset. Then, we will compare to simplistic models. Finally, we will use gradient descent to improve upon these  initial models.\n",

For example, one might define a precision parameter of 0.00001, in which case if the change in the loss function were less then 0.00001, the algorithm would terminate. The idea is that we are very close to the bottom and further iterations would make a negligable difference.\n",
